// classes === constructor functions
// classes - create objects with shared methods

// function Student() {}
In constructor function we have () this parenthess to add properties
 But in class we don't have () parenthesis to pass properties we pass the in side construtor()
//console.log(typeof class Student {});//function

class Student {
  constructor(id, name, subjects = []) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.subjects = subjects;      
  }  
    
  addSubject() {}   any method that is declared inside class are the property of that class and we have the this context of above object inside any method that is in the class
}

// const student1 = Student(1, 'Reed');
// console.log(student1);
