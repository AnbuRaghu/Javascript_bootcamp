Map data type
-------------------

in object only strings can be used as keys
object can't be used as key
object can't be easily itereted over.. we can't easily get the length of object,
how ever map solves all of these problems

map can be created like this.. we have open and close square brackets and we can include over key value pairs inside another set of square brackets
 const map1 = new Map([
 [1, 4], // the 1st 1 is key the 4 is value
 [true, true]  
 ]);


we can also assign new key value pairs for the map using 'set' method like this
 map1.set('key', 'value');
 
 e.g:2
 
 we can give object as key in map
 const user1 = { name: "john" }
 const user2 = { name: "mary" }

 const secretKey1 = "asldjfalskdjf";
 const secretKey2 = "alksdjfakjsdf";
//here instead of map we can use weakmap to easily garbage collecting to avoid heavy memory that comes using map
 const secretKeyMap = new WeakMap([
  [user1, secretKey1],
  [user2, secretKey2]  
]);


we can get the key by using get() method
const key = secretKeyMap.get(user1);
console.log(key);
