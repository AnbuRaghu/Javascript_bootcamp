BaseURL vs Endpoint

endpoint:/post
endpoint is going to be a specific resource at that base url i wanted to get for example /post that represents a list of blog post that live at this api.. when we put together
https://apis.scrimba.com/jsonplaceholder/post

    * Base URL is the part of the URL that won't change, no matter
      which resource we want to get from the API
