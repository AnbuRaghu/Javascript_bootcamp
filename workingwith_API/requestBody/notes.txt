request Body
---------------------------

Body
* the data we want to send to the server
* only make sense with POST and PUT requests
* needs to be turned into JSON first



 Don't add the .then() blocks yet - we have 1 more thing 
  to do before it'll work correctly

Part 2 - add the .then blocks to check the data coming back
